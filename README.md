# RGP_2
Race game. Pick a car, let them zoom

I decided this should be my first personal project using Qt since I have to use the language for university modules and what better way to learn a language that to just dive into the deep end and just make something without any knowledge.
This game was made in honour of a game that i made in School during class. It wasn't pretty but I had an idea and was proud to have accomplished it. I was inspireed to make this since I have an interest in the engineering behind Formula 1 cars.
This game was made using Qt and C++, not a game engine. The code is simple but solving problems was always fun expecially since this isn't made by a game engine.
Source code is provided and an installation file, since i have never made an installation file before. Making progress and learning new things while doing something that didn't have a deadline attatched to it helped me learn a lot of Qt and enjoy my time doing it.
